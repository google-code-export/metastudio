      <h3>Introducing MeTA Studio</h3>
      
      <p> A sizable number of computational chemists (physicists, biologist and material
    scientists alike) use a wide variety of tools to perform computation,
    visualization and presentation. Many a times these are incompatible with
    each other, necessitating reliance on, often cumbersome, external tools to
    perform appropriate conversions. A few of the computational chemists also
    use mirid of programming environments to develop new computational codes or
    visualization tools. However, there is no environment that succinctly
    amalgamates programming environments and various tools available to a
    computational chemist, which many a times hinders easy integration and
    rapid application development. MeTA Studio, a cross-platform, programmable
    environment initially targeted towards computational chemists, intends to
    address this issue by promoting easy re-usability of codes and ways to
    develop new applications and methods based on existing code base. The platform
    consists of components that a computational chemist will need on a day-to-day
    basis: a molecule visualizer, graph plotting APIs, scripting support, a
    workspace environment, a collaboration framework and simple networking APIs.
    MeTA Studio environment can be either used as a tool, or programmed to include
    additional functionalities that are not already present, allowing researchers
    to have a fully customizable environment to experiment, collaborate and evolve
    the base platform. </p>

      <p>Bread-and-butter tools for supporting day-to-day workflow of a
          computational chemists are available within MeTA Studio. The above figure
          depicts various activities that can be performed in MeTA Studio
          runtime environment. These activities can be broadly classified as:
          organize, visualize, code and collaborate. At a deeper level, these
          activities include: a visualizer, a rendering engine, support for
          reading common molecular file formats and outputs from popular quantum
          chemistry programs, a collaboration tool with talk facility to share
          ideas and data quickly among colleagues and a workspace environment for
          organizing work related files.</p>
